# Probability One

## Problem Description

Number guessing is a popular game between elementary-school kids. 
Teachers encourage pupils to play the game as it enhances their arithmetic 
skills, logical thinking, and following-up simple procedures. We think that, 
most probably, you too will master in few minutes. 

Here’s one example of how you too can play this game: Ask a friend to think 
of a number, let’s call it `n0`. Then: 

1. Ask your friend to compute `n1 = 3 * n0` and to tell you if n1 is even or 
odd.
2. If `n1` is even, ask your friend to compute `n2 = n1/2`. If, otherwise, 
`n1` was odd then let your friend compute `n2 = (n1 + 1)/2`.
3. Now ask your friend to calculate `n3 = 3 * n2`.
4. Ask your friend to tell you the result of `n4 = n3/9`. (`n4` is the 
quotient of the division operation. In computer lingo, `/` is the 
integer-division operator.)
5. Now you can simply reveal the original number by calculating 
`n0 = 2 * n4` if `n1` was even, or `n0 = 2 * n4 + 1` otherwise.

Here’s an example that you can follow: If `n0 = 37`, then `n1 = 111` which is 
odd. Now we can calculate `n2 = 56`, `n3 = 168`, and `n4 = 18`, which is 
what your friend will tell you. Doing the calculation `2 * n4 + 1 = 37` 
reveals `n0`.

## Input

Your program will be tested on one or more test cases. 
Each test case is made of a single positive number (`0 < n0 < 1,000,000`). 
The last line of the input file has a single zero (which is not part of the 
test cases.)

## Output

For each test case, print the following line: 

    k. B Q 

Where `k` is the test case number (starting at one,) `B` is either `'even'` or 
`'odd'` (without the quotes) depending on your friend’s answer in step 1. `Q` 
is your friend’s answer to step 4.

## Sample Input

    37
    38
    0

## Sample Output
    
    1. odd 18
    2. even 19
