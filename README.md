Code Solutions to Hackathons of Namibia's University of Science and Technology

## Problem descriptions

The problem descriptions are located in the readme.md files of each problem 
folder. Please note that the `Clarification` sections are not part of the 
official problem description. I have added the `Clarification` sections where 
the problem description might have been confusing.

## Inputs

All inputs to the programs will be provided through text files, even if the 
program description says otherwise.
